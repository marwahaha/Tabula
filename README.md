# Tabula
A command line based implementation of the board game Tabula, with slightly modified rules to the original Roman game. The game is very similar in play to backgammon, but simpler. 

## Prerequisites 
To run this game, the latest version of **Java** needs to be installed. 

## Rules 
* A tabula board consisted of twenty four rectangles aligned in two opposing rows of twelve.   In fact, the same form as a modern Backgammon board - but instead of points, lines divide up the board into twelve sections on either side. 
* In this version of the game, the board is split into 24 rectangular locations, arranged in a rectangle. There are two other locations - the start location where all 15 of both players' counters are held initially, and the 'knocked off' location where counters are moved to if they are 'knocked off' the board.

Each person has fifteen pieces of contrasting hue.  Moves are indicated by three six-sided dice.
